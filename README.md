# Game-Of-Life
An app based on Conway's Game of Life


Since studying computer science, this is probably the biggest project i have written using java. 
It's not perfect, there's room for improvement, but it isn't bad!


There is a runnable .JAR file included in this repository.
You can also run the code from the main GameOfLife.java file. Make sure the Gui.java file is in the same project and it should run fine.
