# Game-Of-Life
An app based on Conway's Game of Life


Since studying computer science, this is probably the biggest project i have written using java. 
It's not perfect, there's room for improvement, but it isn't bad!


There is a runnable .JAR file included in this repository.
You can also run the code from the main GameOfLife.java file in unix type: 

$ javac GameOfLife.java
$ java GameOfLife
                            
Enjoy!
